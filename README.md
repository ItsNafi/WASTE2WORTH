- `PriceDirectory` — material pricing by category with update timestamps

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update your database credentials and JWT secret.

3. Initialize the database using the schema files:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p < schema.sql
mysql -u <user> -p < schema-phase2.sql
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open the app at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🛠️ Development

- `npm start` — start the server
- `npm run dev` — start the server with automatic restart on change

## 📂 Project Structure
